## 1. Running the Backend

- Clone the repository to your local machine.
- Navigate to the backend folder in your terminal.
- Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
- Run `node server.js` to start the backend server.

## 2. Running the Frontend

- Navigate to the frontend folder in your terminal.
- Run `npm install` to install all the necessary dependencies.
- Run `npm run dev` to start the frontend development server.
- Verify that the frontend is running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## 3. Verifying GET Requests

- Ensure the backend is running on the correct port (e.g., port `3333`).
- Make sure the frontend is configured to make GET requests to the backend API on the correct port.

## 4. Common Issues

- **Backend not starting**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and that `server.js` is properly configured.
- **Frontend not loading**: Check if `npm run dev` was successful and there are no port conflicts.
